# Simple Pokédex

This is a complete rewrite of a project I did back in 2016. The code was in dire need of updating so I decided to do it again from scratch, and took the opportunity to try out a couple of things.

I used:

* [TypeScript](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript)
* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
* [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
* [Material-UI](https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui)
* And of course: [The PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) !

Functionalities are:

* View the list of Pokémon that appear in a given Pokédex
* View details about the nature, defenses and stats of a given Pokémon
* Compare the stats and defenses of two given Pokémon
* Generate a random team of 6 Pokémon

You can try it out here: [https://simple-pokedex.herokuapp.com/](https://simple-pokedex.herokuapp.com/)
